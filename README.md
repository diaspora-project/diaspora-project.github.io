# Diaspora: Resilience-enabling services for science from HPC to edge

An AI-guided simulation campaign that engages computers at multiple sites to evaluate many small molecules for use against a new pathogen. A data analysis pipeline that processes data from a scientific instrument in real time so as to enable experimental steering. A multi-messenger astronomy application that integrates data from observational and simulation sites to detect and respond rapidly to rare astronomical events. Each of these mission-critical applications depends on distributed computation for its success and is thus easily subject to disruptions due to  failures, disruptions, and other anomalies.

Our goal in the Diaspora project is to develop new methods for building next-generation resilient scientific applications capable of executing in an increasingly integrated research infrastructure. Experience in other domains, such as public clouds, has demonstrated the power of event-driven communication as a foundation for aresilience solutions. However, such approaches remain virtually unexplored in the scientific computing community due to different scales, scope and service level requirements. This perspective leads us to the following hypothesis.

<ul>
Addressing the resilience needs of a broad set of DOE applications requires methods for gaining knowledge of resources and applications and for translating that knowledge into action. 
These two needs can be met by establishing a **unifying event fabric** that extends across sites, facilities, and computations to provide timely, reliable, and accurate information about data, application, and resource status, and by developing **resilience services** that leverage information provided by this fabric to meet broad classes of resilience needs. 
</ul>

An application is resilient if it can effectively withstand and adapt to various anomalies (failures, disruptions, unexpected events) while continuing to provide its intended level of service. Resilience for an application is thus defined in terms of its intended environment, anomalies of concern, and desired service levels. Achieving resilience requires methods for detecting anomalies and monitoring service levels, and for preparing for or responding to anomalies, for example via fault tolerance, scalability, redundancy, and self-healing protocols, and via adaptive management and partitioning of resources.
